# Foxit (school project)

Hi Humans!

I had to do a school project, so I decided to create a game. It's a platformer game inspired by Mario Bros.
The Prototype mustn't be installed. It can easily be launched by the exe file.

# Notes
This project is only a prototype. I might work on a full game and release it.
# How to play
1. Download all files of the desired operation system.
2. Unpack the 001 File with 7z, winrar or any other such kind of software.
3. Enjoy!
